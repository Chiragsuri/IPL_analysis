-- IPL 2024â€“2025 MySQL Project Script
-- Author: [Chirag Suri]
-- Description: This script sets up the IPL database, imports ball-by-ball data, creates filtered views,
-- and prepares clean datasets for analysis of Orange Cap, Purple Cap, and other performance metrics.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Create and select the working database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ipl2025;
USE ipl2025;

-- 2. Allow loading of local files (needed for LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE)
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';
-- If it says OFF, enable it:
SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;

-- 3. Create the main ball-by-ball data table
-- This table includes cleaned and relevant columns for match analysis

-- 4. Load IPL.csv file into the ball-by-ball table
-- Note: Adjust the file path in LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE as per your system
-- STR_TO_DATE is used for proper date formatting
